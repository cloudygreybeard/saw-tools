# Capacity Planning and Early Performance Detection in Kubernetes Infrastructure

Capacity planning for Kubernetes infrastructure requires both proactive forecasting and reactive monitoring. A well-instrumented cluster offers early warning signs that it may be becoming CPU-bound, memory-constrained, disk I/O-saturated, or network-congested — across both control plane and compute nodes.

This article describes a practical approach for detecting performance bottlenecks using targeted metrics, lightweight sparkline visualisations, PromQL expressions, and field-tested diagnostic techniques.

## Detecting CPU Constraints

### Sparkline Suggestion

- Plot CPU idle percentage per node over time.
- Set alert thresholds for sustained CPU idle below 10%.

### Example Scenario

> **Observation**: A sparkline for CPU idle shows a sharp downward slope during peak business hours, consistently dipping below 5%.  
>  
> **Interpretation**: Compute nodes are heavily utilised; pods may experience throttling or degraded performance.  
>  
> **Action**: Investigate workloads with the highest CPU consumption, assess pod resource requests and limits, and plan for horizontal node scaling.

## Detecting Memory Constraints

### Sparkline Suggestion

- Display node memory utilisation percentage over time.
- Trigger alerts for sustained memory usage exceeding 90%.

### Example Scenario

> **Observation**: The memory usage sparkline for several nodes shows a gradual, steady upward trend over several days, eventually reaching 95%.  
>  
> **Interpretation**: Memory leaks are likely in long-running workloads, or there is poor memory resource balancing.  
>  
> **Action**: Profile memory usage at the pod level, identify suspect workloads, tune resource limits, and apply scheduled restarts if necessary.

## Detecting Disk I/O and Storage Constraints

### Sparkline Suggestion

- Plot percentage of free disk space per node.
- Monitor for gradual downward trends; alert when critical thresholds are crossed.

### Example Scenario

> **Observation**: The disk space sparkline for a control plane node exhibits a staircase-like downward pattern, with sharp drops each night during backup operations.  
>  
> **Interpretation**: Scheduled jobs (e.g., backups) are consuming substantial disk space, posing a risk to node stability.  
>  
> **Action**: Audit scheduled workloads, ensure adequate disk headroom, and offload heavy storage operations to external systems.

## Detecting Network I/O Saturation

### Sparkline Suggestion

- Plot network throughput (bytes per second) alongside packet drop rate.
- Surface alerts when packet loss persists beyond transient fluctuations.

### Example Scenario

> **Observation**: Network throughput remains relatively stable, but packet drops spike intermittently every few hours.  
>  
> **Interpretation**: Bursty traffic patterns are saturating node interfaces or cluster networking components, leading to packet loss.  
>  
> **Action**: Correlate network spikes with scheduled operations or application behaviour, implement traffic shaping policies, or upgrade networking resources.

## Special Considerations for Control Plane Nodes

The stability of the control plane directly affects the availability of the entire Kubernetes cluster. Key metrics include:

- **etcd WAL Fsync Duration**: Spikes indicate storage performance issues impacting etcd consistency and cluster health.
- **API Server Request Latency**: An upward drift may suggest API server overload or authentication backend slowness.

Sparkline trends for these metrics can reveal early warning signs of degradation before severe outages occur.

## Diagnosing Common Anti-Patterns with Sparklines

Many operational risks manifest as characteristic patterns across sparkline dashboards. Common anti-patterns include:

| Pattern Name | Sparkline Appearance | Interpretation | Recommended Action |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| **CPU Sawtooth** | Sharp spikes followed by rapid drops | Bursty workloads (e.g., aggressive autoscalers or batch jobs) | Review autoscaler settings, smooth workload scheduling |
| **Memory Ratcheting** | Gradual, steady rise without decline | Memory leaks or inefficient memory use | Profile workloads, enforce memory limits, plan restarts |
| **Disk Flatline** | Disk free space remains flat and near zero | Disk resources exhausted; node unable to recover | Expand storage, redistribute workloads |
| **Network Spike Bursts** | Sharp network throughput peaks and packet drops | Traffic bursts overwhelming network capacity | Traffic shaping, rescheduling, infrastructure scaling |
| **Control Plane Latency Drift** | API latency slowly rising | Control plane nearing performance limits | Optimise API server performance, scale out control plane nodes |

Careful attention to these patterns allows operators to move from reactive incident response to proactive system improvement.

## Sample PromQL Queries

Example PromQL queries for collecting the key metrics discussed:

```promql
# CPU Idle %
100 - (rate(node_cpu_seconds_total{mode="idle"}[5m]) * 100)

# Memory Usage %
(node_memory_MemTotal_bytes - node_memory_MemAvailable_bytes) / node_memory_MemTotal_bytes * 100

# Disk Space Free %
(node_filesystem_avail_bytes / node_filesystem_size_bytes) * 100

# Network Packet Drops
rate(node_network_receive_drop_total[5m]) + rate(node_network_transmit_drop_total[5m])

# etcd WAL Fsync Duration (control plane)
histogram_quantile(0.99, rate(etcd_disk_wal_fsync_duration_seconds_bucket[5m]))

# API Server Request Latency (control plane)
histogram_quantile(0.99, rate(apiserver_request_duration_seconds_bucket{verb!="WATCH"}[5m]))
```

These queries provide a foundation for custom dashboard panels and alert rules.
